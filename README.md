Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ my name is Joshua Becker and I am a Software Engineer - Full Stack Development: Python, MERN, Java.

âœ¨I am finishing up my coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo soon and have already completed rigorous full stack training in Python, MERN, Java, and Web Fundamentals. I am getting better every day, graduation is fast approaching, and I am hungry to land a job before graduation!

ðŸ”­ Projects: I have been building full stack applications. Check out some of my projects including fhwebsite www.fhspokane.com http://54.241.115.30 a real live full stack application that I built which is being used by the church. Another great project to check out is called shows http://50.18.70.228. You can see more information about both of these projects on both LinkedIn and GitHub. Brief demonstration videos are also available on GitHub for both of these projects.

âš¡ Technologies: I am currently proficient in: Python, JavaScript, MySQL, CSS, HTML, Flask, AWS, GitHub, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Django, Postman, Bootstrap. I am comfortable with many other technologies (see the full curriculum list in my education section on LinkedIn).

ðŸŒ± Objective: Looking to join an amazing team where I can be mentored and have room to grow. I would like to contribute my skills and experience to the further growth and sustainability of a company where there is a prosperous long term career path available so that I do not outgrow it quickly.

I am actively seeking a full time position: Software Engineer Full Stack or Back End.
I am also open to Cloud, Cybersecurity, Data, Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.

My resume can be found on LinkedIn under the featured section. Thank you for your time!
